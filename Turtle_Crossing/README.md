# Turtle Racing Game

This is a simple collision avoidance game created using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Description

Turtle Racing is a game where you control a turtle and try to avoid colliding with randomly generated cars as they move across the screen. The objective is to reach the finish line without crashing into any cars.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing `main.py`.

2. Use the "Up" arrow key to make the turtle move upwards and avoid the moving cars.

3. Avoid colliding with the cars. If the turtle collides with a car or goes out of bounds, the game ends.

4. The game will display your score on the top of the screen, which increases each time you successfully cross the finish line.

## Controls

- Use the "Up" arrow key to move the turtle upwards.

- Click anywhere on the screen to close the game after it's over.
