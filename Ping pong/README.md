# Ping Pong Game



Ping Pong Game is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. It provides a basic gameplay experience where two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth. This project is intended as a beginner-friendly example and can serve as a starting point for building more complex games.

## Features

-   Two-player gameplay: Each player controls a paddle using the 's', 'Up' and 'c', 'Down' arrow keys.
-   Basic collision detection: The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls, as well as the paddles.
-   Minimalistic graphics: The game utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create a simple visual interface.

## Getting Started

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

bashCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/Souheilaso/ping-pong-game.git
cd ping-pong-game` 

Run the `main.py` script to start the game.

bashCopy code

`python main.py` 

## How to Play

-   Player 1: Use the 's' to go up and 'c' to go down. Use these arrow keys to control the left paddle.
-   Player 2: Use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to control the right paddle.

Try to hit the ball with your paddle to prevent it from passing you. The game continues until you decide to close the window.

## Customization

Feel free to modify and expand upon this game. You can enhance the graphics, add sound effects, implement scoring, and create more dynamic gameplay. The `Paddle` class and game loop in `main.py` provide a starting point for building upon this project.
